            <h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
            <p>Highs and lows are a part of life, and life must go on. To keep our lives going on, we need certain conflicts and<br>
                 issues unaddressed. These issues remain under the surface until they all pile up and become a mountain that then<br>
                  starts trying to rupture our emotional skin and break out.At such moments, people usually get puzzled and can't<br>
                   make sense of what is happening to them as they lose track of their past issues. It does not represent any emotional<br>
                    weakness or mental instability. It is natural and happens to everybody.Sometimes, talking with your close friends<br>
                     and family members helps suppress the issues and give you a break until they break out again. And sometimes,<br> 
                     it is just not enough.That is when you need professional help like the one we offer. It would help if you had an<br> 
                     environment where you can talk to somebody who listens, understands and can propose solutions in a non-judgmental<br>
                      and private manner.

                  <h4><p>And you don't need to reach out for professional help only when you are breaking down. Regular therapy sessions,<br> 
                    whenever you feel the need to have one, are very effective to deal with the issues right when they happen. Regular<br>
                    therapy also keeps the issues from piling up and becoming big trouble.Our therapy is highly recommended if you are<br>
                    having a tough time in your life, whether emotionally or psychologically.They are also recommended to avoid being in<br>
                     a tough situation. Not only that, therapy sessions are a very effective way to emotionally and psychologically<br>
                      progress in your life. You may seek counselling if you want to come out of your comfort zone and explore new<br>
                       horizons.Having regular therapy generally is a very healthy practice as it just introduces you and brings you<br>
                        closer to your true self. It teaches you how to brace it, love it, and make the best out of it.<br>
